# Common Use-Cases



### 1. Analyzing Event Latency in Real-Time

**Problem:** The challenge is to understand how the latency of events fluctuates over very short intervals, specifically on a second-by-second basis. This analysis is crucial for identifying performance bottlenecks in real-time systems where even minor delays can impact user experience or system efficiency.

**Solution:** The solution involves using a command sequence to [`bin`](bin-command.md) events into one-second intervals based on their timestamps, and then calculate the average latency for events within each interval.

### 2. Optimizing Network Performance by Analyzing Packet Size Distribution

**Problem:** Network administrators face challenges in managing network performance due to the wide range and uneven distribution of packet sizes. Small packets like ACKs and large data transfers coexist, affecting throughput and efficiency. Identifying patterns and anomalies in packet size distribution is crucial for network optimization and security.

**Solution:** The solution involves using a command sequence to [`bin`](bin-command.md) packet sizes using a logarithmic scale, count the occurrences of each `bin`, and then sort the results to analyze the distribution of packet sizes across the network.

### 3. Device Type Latency Analysis

**Problem:** The objective is to analyze network latency across different device types, identifying which devices experience higher or lower latency. This analysis is crucial for optimizing user experience and network performance for diverse user bases.

**Solution:** Leverage the [`eval`](eval-command.md) and `stats` commands in Splunk to classify devices based on their user agent strings, then calculate the minimum, maximum, and average latency for each device type.

### 4. Protecting Sensitive Information in Search Results

**Problem:** When analyzing data, it's crucial to safeguard sensitive information such as names, social security numbers (SSNs), addresses, and user identifiers. Displaying this information in search results can lead to privacy violations and potential security risks.

**Solution:** To prevent the exposure of sensitive information in search results, the [`fields`](fields-command.md) command in Splunk can be utilized to selectively remove fields that contain potentially identifiable and sensitive data.

### 5. Identifying URLs with High Error Rates

**Problem:** The goal is to identify the top 10 URLs with the highest rates of bad requests or server errors. This analysis is crucial for pinpointing issues that could be affecting user experience or indicating server-side problems.

**Solution:** The [`head`](head-command.md) can be used to fetch the top 10 URLs that have an error rate of at least 50%. If fewer than 10 URLs meet this criterion, the command includes the URL with the highest error rate below 50%.

### 6. Parsing Email Recipients

**Problem:** A company's email server logs contain a field called "recipients" that stores all email recipients as a comma-separated string. The security team wants to analyze email distribution patterns, but they need each recipient as a separate value for proper analysis.

**Solution:** The [`makemv`](makemv-command.md) command can be used to split the "recipients" field into multiple values, allowing for individual analysis of each recipient.

### 7. Optimizing Image Delivery for Improved User Experience

**Problem:** Improving user experience on websites often involves ensuring that image files load quickly across different regions. Slow loading times for images can negatively impact user satisfaction and engagement.

**Solution:** To address this issue, a [`regex`](regex-command.md) search command can be utilized to identify the percentage of slow requests for image files (such as JPG, JPEG, PNG, GIF, WEBP) and analyze the average latency across different countries. This analysis helps in pinpointing regions with performance issues and aids in optimizing content delivery networks (CDNs) or server configurations.

### 8. Identifying Potential Brute Force Attacks

**Problem:** Detecting potential brute force attacks is crucial for maintaining network security. These attacks often involve repeated attempts to connect to critical services like SSH (port 22) or RDP (port 3389) from the same source IP, aiming to guess passwords and gain unauthorized access.

**Solution:** To identify potential brute force attacks, a [`search`](search-command.md) command can be utilized to filter firewall logs for blocked connection attempts to SSH and RDP ports, count the attempts by source and destination IP, and highlight cases with a high number of attempts.


### 9. Identifying Top Performing Sales Representatives

**Problem:** In a competitive sales environment, identifying the top-performing sales representatives is crucial for recognizing achievements and understanding the drivers of sales success. This analysis can help in strategic planning, training, and motivating the sales team.

**Solution:** To identify the top 10 performing sales representatives based on their total sales amount, a search with [`tail`](tail-command.md) command can be utilized. This command aggregates sales data by representative, sorts them by total sales, and then retrieves the bottom 10 records having the highest total sales, displaying them in reverse to prioritize top-performing representatives.

### 10. Analyze the top products purchased by customer segments

**Problem:** A user wants to analyze the top products purchased by different customer segments to understand purchasing behavior and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

**Solution:** The [`top`](top-command.md) command can be used to find the most commonly purchased products for each customer segment, along with the count and percentage of total purchases.

### 11. Identify transactions with the same session ID and IP address

**Problem:** A user wants to group web access events into transactions based on the same session ID and IP address. Each transaction should start with an event containing the string "view" and end with an event containing the string "purchase." Additionally, the user wants to filter out transactions that took less than a second to complete and display the duration and event count for each transaction.

**Solution:** The [`transaction`](transaction-command.md) command can be used to define a transaction based on the session ID (`JSESSIONID`) and IP address (`clientip`). The `startswith` and `endswith` arguments specify the start and end events of the transaction. The `where` command can then be used to filter transactions based on their duration.

### 12. Analyzing Revenue from Expensive Products

**Problem:** The goal is to identify and analyze expensive products (those with prices greater than $1000) to determine the total revenue, as well as the minimum, maximum, and average prices of these products across each product category.

**Solution:** The solution involves using a combination of the [`where`](where-command.md) and `stats` commands in a Splunk search to filter and analyze the data.
